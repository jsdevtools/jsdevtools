# Services
This directory is intended for packages that define services that are used by one or more projects.

Add `@jsdt/dev-dependencies` to devDependencies for consistent tools / versions across projects.

Share configs across projects by extending and overriding `@jsdt/*-config` in `package.json`. Check out which shared configs are avialable in `packages/configs/`. See some examples in `packages/shared-components/`.
